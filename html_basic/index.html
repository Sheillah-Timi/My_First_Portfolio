  <h1><h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>
  <p>This is the very first webpage I built as part of my ALX journey. I'm excited to learn and grow in web development!</p>

  <h2>About This Project</h2>
  <p>This page demonstrates basic HTML structure including headings, paragraphs, and images with links.</p>

  <h3>Why I am Learning HTML</h3>
  <p>HTML is the foundation of the web. Understanding it allows me to build and structure webpages clearly and correctly.</p>

  <p>As I grow in web development, I plan to learn CSS, JavaScript, and more advanced frameworks to build interactive websites.</p>
